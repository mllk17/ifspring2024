            <span class="emphasis">Saturday sunset</span> 
            <br>
            We're lying on my bed with five hours to go
            <br>
            Fingers entwined and so were our minds
            <br>
            Cryin', <span class="emphasis">"I don't want you to go"</span>
            <br>
            You wiped away your tears
            <br>
            But not fears under the still and clear indigo
            <br>
            You said, <span class="emphasis">"Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine</span>
            <br>
            You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow"
        </p>

        <p>  
            My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
            <br>
            Well, nothing then, much has changed
            <br>
            'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
            <br>
            My soul, it gets <span class="emphasis">sicker</span>
            <br>
            But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
            <br>
            Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
        </p>

        <p>
            How is it now that somehow you're a strangеr?
            <br>
            <span class="emphasis">You were mine just yеsterday</span>
            <br>
            I pray the block in my airway dissipates
            <br>
            And instead deters your airplane's way
            <br>
            But heaven <span class="emphasis">denied</span>
            <br>
            Destiny <span class="emphasis">decried</span>
            <br>
            Something beautiful <span class="emphasis">died too soon</span>
        </p>  

        <p>
            But I'm <span class="emphasis">letting go</span>
            <br>
            I'm givin' up <span class="emphasis">the ghost</span>
            <br>
            But don't get me wrong
            <br>
            I'll always love you, that's why
            <br>
            I wrote you this <span class="emphasis">very last song</span>
        </p> 
      
        <p>
            I guess this is where we say <span class="emphasis">goodbye</span>
            <br>
            I know I'll be alright
            <br>
            Someday I'll be <span class="emphasis">fine</span>
            <br>
            But just not <span class="emphasis">tonight</span> (ooh)
        </p>    
    </div>  

    <div style="width: 50%; float:right"> 
        <p>
            Plungin' into all kinds of diversions
            <br>
            Like <span class="emphasis">blush wine</span> and <span class="emphasis">sonorous soirées</span>
            <br>
            But even with <span class="emphasis">gin</span> and <span class="emphasis">surgin' adrenaline</span>
            <br>
            I see you're all that can intoxicate
        </p>  
        
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Oceans and engines</span>
            <br>
            You're skilled at infringin' on great <span class="emphasis">love affairs</span>
            <br>
            'Cause now my heart's home
            <br>
            All I've known is long gone and <span class="emphasis">ten thousand miles away</span>
            <br>
            And I'm not <span class="emphasis">okay</span>
        </p>    
            
        <p>
            But I'm letting go
            <br>
            I'm <span class="emphasis">giving up the ghost</span>
            <br>
            But don't get me wrong
            <br>
            I'll always love you, that's why
            <br>
            I wrote you this <span class="emphasis">very last song</span>
        </p>    
            
        <p>
            I guess this is where we say <span class="emphasis">goodbye</span>
            <br>
            I know I'll be alright
            <br>
            But just not
        </p>    
            
        <p>
            Tonight was the first time I stared into seas
            <br>
            Of beguiling sepia two years ago
            <br>
            And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words
            <br>
            <span class="emphasis">They revitalize my fraying bones, oh</span>
            <br>
            Now what do you do when your pillar crumbled down
            <br>
            You've lost all solid ground
            <br>
            Both dreams and demons <span class="emphasis">drowned</span>
            <br>
            And this void's all you've found
            <br>
            And doubts light it aglow?
        </p>    
            
        <p id="song-title"> 
            I have so many questions
            <br>
            But I'm <span class="emphasis">pouring them into the ocean</span>
            <br>
            And I'm <span class="emphasis">starting up my engine</span>
        </p>    
            
        <p>
            And I'm letting go
            <br>
            I'm givin' up your ghost
            <br>
            It's come to a close
            <br>
            I marked the end with this last song I wrote
            <br>
            I'm letting go
            <br>
            This is the <span class="emphasis">last falsetto</span>
            <br>
            I'll ever sing to you
            <br>
            <span class="emphasis">My great lost love</span>
