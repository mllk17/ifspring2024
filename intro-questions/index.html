                Hi, I'm Michelle Kwan, a senior! I'm studying computer science with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.

            <li>
                I have a bit of web development background, but I'm hoping to have more experience in web design overall.

            <li>
                I have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I have taken a web development class before.
            </li>
            <li>
                One thing I hope learn in this class is to focus more on design rather than just functionality. When working on website creations, I tend to focus more on whether it works rather than its appearance. I hope to incorporate both mindsets in future works.

                One way I expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper is that you need to consider how responsive and interactive a screen. I also find it more difficult to place items on a screen in an exact way you had imagined on paper.

                A website I think exemplifies effective design is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a>. Interacting with the website is an entire experience. They emphasize particular products and highlight key facts about them. The website overall offers a sleek and modern appearance, which falls in line with its image. 
            </li>

                A website I think exemplifes effective communication is <a href="https://whitney.org/">The Whitney Museum of Art's website</a>. It clearly offers current exhibitions, guide to the museum, and how to book tickets. It also fits its image as an art museum. An user can clearly find information they need.
            </li>
            <li>
                A website I think works well is <a href="https://eng.polene-paris.com/">Polene's website</a>. It serves a combination of effective design and communication. It includes aesthetic images and videos of the products along with clear information on colors available and pricing of the products.
